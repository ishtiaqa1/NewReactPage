          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Ishtiaq, and I’m from the Bronx, New York. Growing up in the city with immigrant parents taught me to be resourceful, curious, and persistent, all of which have shaped both who I am and how I approach learning and problem-solving. From an early age, I was drawn to technology and computers, fascinated by how code could bring ideas to life. Over the years, I found myself constantly tinkering with tinkering with development tools, minecraft mods, json files, https cookies and so much more.

  My journey in tech has not followed the traditional path. I initially started pursuing a conventional computer science degree at the University at Buffalo, but I realized that college alone wasn’t giving me the hands-on experience I craved. I wanted more than just theory, I wanted to build, experiment, and see my work in action. That’s why I decided, from several friends advice, to attend <a href='https://www.marcylabschool.org/'>The Marcy Lab School</a>. At Marcy, I could immerse myself in real-world projects, collaborate with other passionate learners, and focus on practical skills that would directly prepare me for a career in software development.  It was the right choice for me because it allowed me to learn by doing, and it gave me the freedom to explore the areas of tech I’m most passionate about, from frontend design to backend development.
  At Marcy, I’ve worked on projects involving UI, UML diagrams, Object Oriented Programming, and so much more.

  I enjoy creating web applications that are not only functional but also visually engaging. Some of my favorite projects include building interactive dashboards, integrating APIs for dynamic content, and developing projects that challenge both my creativity and technical skills. I particularly love working on full-stack applications because they let me combine the logic and structure of the backend with the design and usability of the frontend. I also enjoy exploring small, fun APIs, like Pokémon data, weather info, or random advice generators, and turning them into projects that are interactive and engaging.
  Looking ahead, my dream has always been to become a software engineer who can build tools and applications that genuinely improve people’s lives. I want to continue growing as a developer, learning new technologies, and taking on projects that push me to think critically and creatively. Marcy has given me the foundation to pursue that dream, and I’m excited to take the next steps in my career, whether that’s building my own projects, contributing to open-source work, or joining a team where I can keep learning and making an impact.
          </p>
          <p>
  Beyond coding, I’m passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. I approach every project with curiosity and a desire to grow. I love experimenting with new ideas, solving challenging problems, and finding ways to make technology more fun and accessible. I believe that with dedication, creativity, and practical experience, anyone can create meaningful, innovative work—and I’m committed to doing that every day.
  In short, I’m a Bronx native, a self-driven learner, and a passionate coder. My journey to Marcy Lab School reflects my desire to take ownership of my education, follow my interests, and build the skills I need to turn my dreams into reality. I’m excited about the future, the projects I’ll create, and the opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and grow in the world of technology.
